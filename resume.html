                  <p>At Natura, I manage the full supply chain process across online and offline channels, including leading the S&amp;OP process and a team of six supply chain specialist. I implemented a third-party forecasting tool integrated with machine learning algorithms, improving demand forecast accuracy by 16% and reducing excess inventory by 9%, while maintaining service levels above 94%. I coordinated logistics optimization projects that shortened lead times by 15% and enhanced product flow across two hundred stores. My work on e-commerce availability strategies led to a 20% increase in online product availability. I also act as a key liaison between Supply Chain, Commerce, Marketing, and Finance, ensuring strategic alignment and data-driven planning decisions throughout the organization.</p>

                  <p>As a Business Analyst at Biedronka HQ, I focused on leveraging customer behavior data from the Moja Biedronka mobile app to drive actionable insights. I developed churn prediction models and click-rate analyses, enabling the marketing and commercial teams to optimize promotion strategies. The new churn model achieved 6% better tracking accuracy compared to the previous version, allowing more precise targeting of at-risk customer segments. I also performed fraud detection and store-level promotion effectiveness studies, integrating both quantitative and behavioral data to support loyalty program improvements and sellout growth.</p>

                  <p>In the Demand Planning division, I was responsible for forecasting promotional and baseline sales for over 2,500 SKUs using models such as Random Forest and polynomial regression. My forecasting initiatives improved demand accuracy by 9% and enabled proactive communication with suppliers. I also coordinated cross-functional implementation of new assortment items and built analytical tools to identify sales anomalies, leading to a reduction of lost sales by over 3%. My forecasts supported six national warehouses and helped align inventory with commercial priorities, enhancing availability during peak promotional cycles.</p>

                  <p>As a Supply Chain Specialist at Natura, I managed nationwide inventory planning across all retail stores using SARIMA models to forecast demand with seasonal patterns. I worked closely with teams responsible for merchandising, store operations, and warehouse strategy to align inventory levels with sales potential and product rotation cycles. By setting minimum inventory thresholds by product group and implementing an ABC classification system, I helped ensure high availability of key items while reducing overstock on slow-moving products. I also led cross-functional initiatives to improve the flow of demand data and created automated dashboards to monitor sales performance against forecast KPIs, enhancing decision-making and responsiveness.</p>

                  </h3>
                  <p>Developed a forecasting pipeline in Python using XGBoost to predict daily sales across multiple retail stores. The solution integrates historical transaction data and store metadata, processes it with feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (PCA), and generates forecasts with model validation. The results are visualized through interactive plots showing prediction accuracy and feature importance, enabling stakeholders to assess model reliability and key sales drivers.</p>

                      <li>Feature importance plots and actual vs. predicted sales line charts using matplotlib for model interpretability</li><li>Modular design ready for deployment in Jupyter, with extensibility for test data forecasting and dashboard integration</li><li>Enabled rapid prototyping of machine learning forecasts to support data-driven retail operations planning</li>
